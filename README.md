Custom Markers: Each SBHC location is marked with custom icons representing the type of services offered (e.g., mental health, dental services, primary care).
Pop-ups: Clicking on a marker shows additional information about the SBHC, including address, contact details, and available services.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for SBHCs by location, name, or services offered.
Mobile-Friendly: The map is responsive and can be viewed on desktop and mobile devices.
